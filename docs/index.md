# Open Community Groups Documentation

Open Community Groups (OCG) helps communities run groups, events, and speaker programs in one
platform. These docs are written for execution: understand the model quickly, run your workflow,
and know where to go when something behaves differently than expected.

## How OCG Is Organized

OCG has one public participation layer and three dashboard workspaces.

### Public Site

The [public site](/ ':ignore') is where discovery and participation happen: finding groups in
[Explore](/explore ':ignore'), RSVP'ing to events, checking in, and submitting to Call for Speakers.

### User Dashboard

The [user workspace](/dashboard/user ':ignore') is personal and persistent. It holds profile, invitations,
reusable session proposals, and submission outcomes.

### Community Dashboard

The [community workspace](/dashboard/community ':ignore') is strategic and governance-oriented. Use it to
manage community identity, team access, analytics, and group lifecycle.

### Group Dashboard

The [group workspace](/dashboard/group ':ignore') is operational. Use it to run events, manage organizers
and members, and keep sponsor and communication workflows moving.
