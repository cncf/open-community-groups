# Choose Your Dashboard

OCG has three dashboards, each scoped to a different level of responsibility. Think of them as
three workspaces that stack: personal work (`User`), community governance (`Community`), and
execution at the group/event layer (`Group`).

## How to Pick the Right Workspace

Start from your role in the workflow, not from the menu label. This matrix combines intent,
access model, and expected outcomes in one view:

| If you need to... | Use this dashboard | Who gets it | Core outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Manage your profile, invitations, proposals, and submissions | [`User Dashboard`](/dashboard/user ':ignore') | Any logged-in user | Keep profile current, accept invitations, submit to CFS |
| Manage community-wide identity, admins, analytics, and groups | [`Community Dashboard`](/dashboard/community ':ignore') | Community team members | Operate the community, team, branding, and group lifecycle |
| Run events, organizers, members, sponsors, and day-to-day operations | [`Group Dashboard`](/dashboard/group ':ignore') | Group team members | Deliver events, manage members, coordinate organizers and sponsors |

## Access Model and Why It Matters

Dashboard visibility is role-driven. If a dashboard is missing from your menu, your account does
not currently hold that role.

The two organizer dashboards are also context-driven:

- [`Community Dashboard`](/dashboard/community ':ignore') requires a selected community.
- [`Group Dashboard`](/dashboard/group ':ignore') requires both a selected community and a selected group.

Without the right context, organizer pages can block actions until selection is complete.

## If a Dashboard Is Missing

Use this order to unblock quickly:

1. Open [`User Dashboard -> Invitations`](/dashboard/user?tab=invitations ':ignore').
2. Accept pending community/group invitations.
3. Refresh the page (or sign out/in).
4. Re-open your avatar menu and check for new dashboard entries.

If visibility still does not update, use

## Typical Starting Paths

### Member or speaker path

Start in [`User Dashboard`](/dashboard/user ':ignore'), complete your profile, then create session proposals
only when you need to submit to event CFS.

Continue with [User Dashboard Guide](../guides/user-dashboard.md) and
[Public Site Guide](../guides/public-site.md).

### Community lead path

Start in [`Community Dashboard`](/dashboard/community?tab=settings ':ignore') to verify settings and team
membership first, then move to [`Groups`](/dashboard/community?tab=groups ':ignore') to ensure structure and
ownership are correct before scaling activity.

Continue with [Community Dashboard Guide](../guides/community-dashboard.md).

### Group organizer path

Start in [`Group Dashboard`](/dashboard/group?tab=settings ':ignore') and move straight into
[`Events`](/dashboard/group?tab=events ':ignore'), because event setup, publishing, attendance, and
submissions are the operational center of group work.

Continue with [Group Dashboard Guide](../guides/group-dashboard.md) and
[Event Operations](../guides/event-operations.md).
