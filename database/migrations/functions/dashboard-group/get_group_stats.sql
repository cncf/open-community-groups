-- Returns group statistics as a JSON object.
--
-- The function computes statistics for 3 domains scoped to a single group or
-- to a group and its active subgroups:
--   - members
--   - events
--   - attendees
--
-- Each domain includes:
--   - total: Total count of entities
--   - running_total: Cumulative total over time (all-time)
--   - per_month: Monthly counts (last 2 years)
--
-- View metrics are grouped under page_views by total, group, and events and include:
--   - total_views: Total page views
--   - per_day_views: Daily page views (last month)
--   - per_month_views: Monthly page views (last 2 years)
--
-- Time series data is returned as arrays of [timestamp/value] pairs where
-- timestamps are Unix milliseconds.
